# A simple set of steps

Read the problem completely twice.
Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
Optimize the manual steps.
Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
Optimize the real code.


# As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.


If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.  Do not worry about wasting time here, because the better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.

It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around.  Which while can be fun, will make you look like an idiot in a programming interview and will probably cause you to sweat profusely.

What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

Write “Zebra” down.
Start at the last letter in the word and create a new empty word.
Append the current letter to the new word
If there is a previous letter, make the previous letter the current letter and start back at 3.

Many times you can skip this step if you have a really good handle on the problem or your previous steps already created a detailed enough description of the solution that coding it is already a 1 to 1 translation.



# Replace comments with real code

The only way you are going to have confidence in this process is to practice it.  It takes a good amount of faith to believe that spending 70% of your 30 minutes to solve a problem just thinking about the problem and not writing any code is the right approach, so make sure you have that faith when you need it.

# “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness

# “The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”


“Indeed the state of all who are preoccupied is wretched, but the most wretched are those who are toiling not even at their own preoccupations…If such people want to know how short their lives are, let them reflect how small a portion is their own.”




# “Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss


# “Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”


“People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.”



You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them


“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”


“Living in frenzy is a sign we’ve squandered too much.” -Niklas Goke

# Try a solution.
If that doesn’t work, try another one.
If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

### 1. Understand

### 2. Plan


### 3. Divide

### 4. Stuck?


You also know that problem-solving is an incredible skill to cultivate (the meta-skill).
