Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
1. Better program design and higher code quality
2. Detailed project documentation
3. TDD reduces the time required for project development





In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?.
The difference is beforeEach()/afterEach() automatically run before and after each tests, which 1. removes the explicit calls from the tests themselves, and 2. invites inexperienced users to share state between tests.


What is one downside of Test Driven Development
So they cannot maintain themselves. The tests are hard to write because the code is more complex to write and understand. The development of the code is slow. ... The code of TDD is hard to understand as we know writing a code and writing a code well is different


Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
ES6 class constructors
This can be said to be a syntax base for constructor functions and instantiate objects using a new operator.	


ES5 function constructors
This also uses a new operator for object creation but focuses on how the objects are being instantiated.




Why REST?

REST aims to make caching easier. Since the server is stateless and each request can be processed individually, GET requests should usually return the same response regardless of previous ones and the session. This makes the GET requests easily cacheable and browsers usually treat them as such
