Write the following steps in the correct order:

Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
Make a request to the access token endpoint
Receive access token
Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
Receive authorization code






What can you do with an authorization code?
An authorization code is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space.


What can you do with an access token?
Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user's data. Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage.


Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
OAuth doesn't share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers. OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving away your password

Term

Client ID
Client ID means the unique means of identification (in the form or a combination of a password, PIN, personal identification or an Electronic Key) assigned to or selected by You.

Client Secret

A client secret is a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors. Protect your client secrets and never include them in mobile or browser-based apps.


Authentication Endpoint

Endpoint authentication is a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to a given network, site or service. The approach is also known as device authentication. ... The password response sent from the registered device verifies that the user is connecting from an authorized endpoint.


Access Token Endpoint
Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. ... The token endpoint is where apps make a request to get an access token for a user. This section describes how to verify token requests and how to return the appropriate response and errors


API Endpoint
Simply put, an endpoint is one end of a communication channel. When an API interacts with another system, the touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints. For APIs, an endpoint can include a URL of a server or service. ... The place that APIs send requests and where the resource lives, is called an endpoint.


Authorization Code
An authorization code is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space.


Access Token
